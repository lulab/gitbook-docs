## I. Imputation, Normalization and Batch Correction

* **Methods for Single Cell RNA-seq** 
  * \(1\) Dropout/Sparseness and Imputation
  * \(2\) Heterogeneity and Normalization
  * \(3\) Batch effect and Confounder
  * \(Pseudo-time and Others\)
* **Recommendations**:
  * 2020 _Nature COMMN_ - Embracing the **dropouts** in single-cell RNA-seq analysis
  * 2019 - _Nature Methods_ - A discriminative learning approach to differential expression analysis for single-cell RNA-seq
  * 2017 - _Nature Methods_ - Normalizing single-cell RNA sequencing data: challenges and opportunities
